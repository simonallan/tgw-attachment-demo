## Purpose
This is a short demonstration showing how AWS TGW (Transit Gateway) has been deployed at CRUK.

## Fudge your way through
The accompanying bash scripts launch CloudFormation templates that build each step. The [included deck](https://github.com/simonallan/tgw-attachment-demo/blob/main/docs/tgw-reconstruction-demo.pptx)
has vague directions on how to proceed.
